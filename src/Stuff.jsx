          between different views while maintaining a seamless user experience. Version 6 brings significant improvements and simplifications to the routing process. It introduces
          a more component-focused approach to defining routes making it easier to implement routing into your application. Additionally it offers features such as 
          nested routes, client side routing and relative links just to name a few. All these features combined provide a robust and 
          flexible solution for handling routing in modern React applications.</p>
